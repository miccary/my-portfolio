    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is part of the M5 Forecasting Challenge, focusing on predicting unit sales for Walmart stores across three US states: California, Texas, and Wisconsin. The goal is to estimate daily sales for the next 28 days using historical sales data and advanced forecasting techniques.</p>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>We are tasked with predicting the unit sales of various products sold by Walmart using hierarchical sales data and additional explanatory variables like price, promotions, and special events.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This project leverages both traditional forecasting methods and machine learning techniques to improve forecast accuracy. By analyzing item-level data, store-level data, and external factors such as price and promotions, this project creates accurate point forecasts for Walmartâ€™s sales.</p>

    <section class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Accurate forecasting helps reduce waste, optimize inventory levels, and improve overall operational efficiency. The methodology applied in this project can be transferred to other business cases where sales forecasting and uncertainty estimation are critical.</p>
