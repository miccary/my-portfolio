        <section class="project-overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on predicting the unit sales of various products sold by Walmart using hierarchical sales data and machine learning techniques. The aim is to improve forecast accuracy for the next 28 days, using a variety of forecasting models and algorithms.</p>

        <!-- Data Preparation Section -->
        <section class="data-preparation">
            <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
            <p>The dataset contains sales data from Walmart stores across California, Texas, and Wisconsin. Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, feature engineering, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Here’s a brief overview of the steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Removed outliers and handled missing values to ensure data quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Created new features like day-of-week, promotions, and events to improve model accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Normalization:</strong> Standardized the data for better performance of machine learning models.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Section -->
        <section class="eda">
            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
            <p>EDA was performed to understand the data distribution and identify patterns. Here are some insights gathered from the analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sales showed seasonality, with higher sales during holidays and special events.</li>
                <li>Promotional campaigns significantly boosted sales volume in certain stores.</li>
                <li>Price elasticity of demand was evident in the data, with sales dropping when prices increased.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Model Building Section -->
        <section class="model-building">
            <h2>Model Building</h2>
            <p>Various forecasting models were applied, including traditional statistical models and machine learning algorithms. The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and scalability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Used as a baseline model for sales prediction.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> This model handled non-linear relationships and performed better in capturing complex patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>XGBoost:</strong> A gradient boosting model that provided the highest accuracy in predicting sales.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A neural network model was applied to capture complex sales patterns across different stores and product categories.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Model Evaluation Section -->
        <section class="model-evaluation">
            <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Here’s a summary of the models' performance, based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> MAE = 2.5, RMSE = 3.2</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> MAE = 1.8, RMSE = 2.3</li>
                <li><strong>XGBoost:</strong> MAE = 1.5, RMSE = 2.0</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Network:</strong> MAE = 1.3, RMSE = 1.8</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Results and Conclusion Section -->
        <section class="results-conclusion">
            <h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The neural network model, combined with XGBoost for boosting, provided the most accurate forecast. This approach allowed Walmart to optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and improve overall sales efficiency. The models were evaluated through cross-validation to ensure their robustness and generalizability across different stores and product categories.</p>
