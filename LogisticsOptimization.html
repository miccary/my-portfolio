            <h2>Data Processing and Feature Engineering</h2>
            <p>The dataset includes historical logistics data, such as package dimensions, travel times, and route information. Data cleaning and feature engineering were conducted to derive metrics like package density and service time ratio, crucial for building robust predictive models.</p>
            <p>Below is a snippet of the code used for data processing and feature engineering.</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
        # Load logistics data
        import pandas as pd
        
        # Read the dataset
        data = pd.read_csv('logistics_data.csv')
        
        # Feature engineering: calculate cost per distance ratio
        data['cost_per_distance'] = data['cost'] / data['distance']
        
        # Handle missing values and clean data
        data = data.dropna()
        
        # Example of basic feature processing
        print(data.head())

            <h2>Modeling</h2>
            <p>Various machine learning models were trained to predict package delivery success rates, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Advanced algorithms like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and a combination of Neural Networks with graph-based algorithms were used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for route optimization.</p>
            <p>The following optimization algorithms were applied to improve logistics efficiency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Genetic Algorithm</li>                             
                <li>Simulated Annealing</li>
